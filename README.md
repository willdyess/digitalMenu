# Digital Menu

This project is a digital menu that can be used by any restaurant to allow their servers to have a pocket reference of what foods contain what allergies. 

It is configurable by spreadsheet using the apps built in .csv to .json converter. This means management can create a spreadsheet of their menu, and Digital Menu will ingest it and create a web application. 

This allows for quick and easy updating, and the potential to manage multiple menus across multiple locations with a central spread sheet.
